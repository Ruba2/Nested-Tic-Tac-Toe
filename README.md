# Nested-Tic-Tac-Toe (Also called Nested Noughts and Crosses)

# What is it?
Nested Tic Tac Toe is a variant of the famous Tic-Tac-Toe that adds more strategy to the game.

# How to play?
The game is a board made of nine grids. Each grid is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. The player who succeeds in winning three grids that are on the same vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row wins the game. The catch is that each player chooses where the other player plays on the board by placing their mark in that place on the grid.
